            In this section you will see six different digital Images. Some are digital modified images and other are originally created images. 
            You can see all the manipulation details in each each image section.

        The first manipulated image I'm presenting is an alternative to use as Hero image for the website. The original image is a JPEG that I found on a royalty-free images stock with a relatitly high size. I proceed to do the following changes:
           <p>1. Firstly I cropped the image so it would have a rectangle shape that would fit the Website header better. </p> 
           <p>2. I added a layer, placed it before the image layer, and then used the paint bucket tool to paint the background in white.</p> 
           <p>3. Then I set the opacity of the Image layer to 28% so there wouldn’t be any visual noise - for it to appear cleaner and to be easier to read the text.</p> 
           <p>4. I created a text box and wrote the name of the brand and a small and short description of the brand. </p>
           <p>5. I set the layout guides so I could center the text in the image. </p>
           <p>6. Finally, I saved the image for the Web and picked Medium-quality JPEG so it wouldn’t lose its quality. </p>

                    This picture was taken by me but had a yellowish tone to it and its size was also too big to use in any website or on social media, so I decided to use it as an example of a manipulated image. To correct its colour and optimize it for the web I took the following steps: 
                       <p>1. I created a new adjustments layer and picked the Curves. </p> 
                       <p>2. On Curves I chose the pipet and clicked on a white area of the image so it would adjust the right tone automatically and it would look a bit whiter. This took a few tries until it felt like the right tone.</p> 
                       <p>3. I then clicked on the RGB dropdown menu and clicked on each color and adjusted them a bit more. </p> 
                       <p>4. I added another adjustment layer and chose Brightness/Contrast. I reduced the Contrast all the way to -50 and increased the brightness to 30. </p>
                       <p>5. Finally I exported the file, and saved it to the web as a Low-quality JPEG. As you can see the image suffered a huge change when it comes to its size whiteout loosing any significant quality.  </p>

                    This is another free-royalty image that I thought would be nice to use it either on the website or on social media. Even thought I really liked the image I felt like it was a bit cluttered as it had too many elements going on. I chose to change that and took one of them off. To reach that I went through this phases: 
                       <p>1. For this image I used the Clone Stamp tool and copy a specific area of the image and stamp it on top of the honey spoon.  </p> 
                       <p>2. I did this a few times until I was happy with how it looked. I varied the places from where I would copy the white area so it would fit the right light of the image.</p> 
                       <p>3. Finally I saved it for the web and chose the Medium-quality JPEG option. </p>

        <h3>4. Logos </h3>

            <div class="explanation-text">
                    For the fifth image I decided to do a small board with a few options of what the brand logo could look like. Here are a few that I decided to do, all within the same theme and colors, related with the mockups. I chose one as a file to download. Bellow I’m going to briefly explain each one of them. 
                       <p>1. Firstly I begun by creating the colourful circle that you can see on the last image. I create that using an App called Procreate. After I did the small illustration I exported it to Photoshop and then created two different text boxes, one “INCREDI” and other “BOWLS”. I duplicated the layer that had the illustration and assign one to each text box. Then turn each text layer into a clipping mask so the image that was behind the text was printed on it.   </p> 
                       <p>2. In the second one I did the same process to create the colourful circle. I created a circle with the Elipse tool, set it to have no color inside and to have an outline of 12,87 px. Then I placed the colorful circle illustration used in the previous image, placed it on top of the Elipse layer and set it to clipping mask. The “IND” initials were also created by me on Procreate, I added later its layer to fit inside the circle. </p> 
                       <p>3. The third logo was simple to create. I created a text box and wrote “INCREDIBOWLS” and then use the rectangle shape to the outside. I set the rectangle to have no colour in the interior and set the boarder to have 12,87px and the same colour as the text.  </p> 
                       <p>4. To do the circular logo I used the Elipse tool to create a circle. I turned the circle transparent so only the outline would stay. I then chose the text tool and place it on the boarder of the Elipse. Then I was able to write over the line of the circle. Finally, I wrote the brand's name with the blue used in other logos.</p>
                       <p>5. To do the fifth logo I simply created two different color rectangles and two different text boxes. I used white for the text inside the boxes to get the intended results.</p>
                       <p>6. For the last logo I used the circle previously created with Procreate and created two text boxes. I gave a higher letter spacing to the “BOWLS” text so they could be aligned. I did the same on the first logo as well. </p>

          I intended to use this PNG as the shopping cart icon that normally appears on the right top of the webpages. However I wanted to changed it so it would fit the colours of the website and of the logo.
           <p>1. Firstly, whith the bucket paint tool I changed the colours of the details of the image to the same ones I used on the logos. </p>
           <p>2. Secondly, I saved it for the web, reducing the size of the image significantly. I didn't feel the need to change its dimensions as that could be easily done with CSS when buidling the website.</p>

          I did this illustration on Procreate, which is an illustration App that have similar tools of Photoshop. I incorporated the colours used on the logos in the illustration, and did an image that it could be used on Social Media that would be related with the brand. To achieve that I followed these steps:
           <p>1. I started by opening the original image and set its opacity to 60%.</p>
           <p>2. I added another layer and sketch over the image’s outlines with a pencil brush.</p>
           <p>3. After that I added a few different layers, each one corresponded to each part of the image. With a contouring brush I coloured each one of them.</p>
           <p>4. After that I just did some finishing touches and added some details to the illusttration.  </p>
           <p>5. Finally I exported it to Photoshop and save it for the Web so it would have a smaller size.</p>
