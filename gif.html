        <p>
                I created a GIF thought to be used on social media campaign announcing a new recipe on the website. It’s a simple message but that catches the eye. Even thought the yellow is not the best colour to use for text with a white background I chose it to fit the brand's colours and so the text colour would also fit the image's colours and scenery.
      </p>
      <div class="gif">
        <img src="GIF.gif" alt="gif">
</div>
        <p class="image-info">Original Image (JPEG, 1,3MB, 5456 x 3637)</p>

        <div class="explanation-text">
                To achieve this result,  I:
                 <p>1. Started by saving the background image for the web, reducing its size so the GIF wouldn’t get to big by the end. </p>
                 <p>2. Then structure it and created all the layers that I would like to see at the end on the image. </p>
                 <p>3. More specifically, I created each text layer and then with the Elipse tool I created a circle, which I took its color off, and with the text tool wrote on its margin multiple verticle bars to give the circling effect.  </p>
                 <p>3. Opened the timeline and added frames. </p>
                 <p>4. As I did that I took the visibility off all layers and started adding them again gradually, frame by frame until I reached the intended result.  </p>
